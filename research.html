	<SUMMARY>"<U>Patience Across Payday</U>"</SUMMARY>
	<DT> * <A HREF="doc/Dykstra_Payday.pdf">Manuscript [PDF]</A> <BR><BR>
	<DT> ABSTRACT: Individuals often behave impatiently when making financial decisions. This paper proposes and tests that the timing of decisions relative to payday—which leads to strong fluctuations in liquidity for many individuals—influences the decision they make. In a large pre-registered experiment, I ask participants to adopt a commitment device that binds them to being patient. Participants who make this decision eight days before their payday, rather than one day after payday, are 38% more likely to take up commitment. This coincides with when individuals feel most constrained by their finances, and suggests that intertemporal decisions are affected by psychological states. <BR>

	<DT> ABSTRACT: A common policy problem is that individuals reject recommended options and insist on making their own choices. Via a large-scale experiment, we document and investigate what factors contribute to this preference for agency. Our main results show that individuals' willingness to give up their agency increases when they are less determined about what they would choose. Additional results suggest that this is due to the fact that forgoing agency allows them to avoid making decisions.

	<DT> ABSTRACT: Dramatic reductions in carbon emissions must take place immediately. A human-centric method of reducing environmental impacts is to “nudge” people away from single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) toward more sustainable commuting options. While an abundance of research has focused on external determinants of mode choice, we know much less about the behavioral determinants. The field of behavioral science is overdue for a focus on transportation. This paper is meant to facilitate communication between researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in part by developing a behaviorally-informed framework that can be leveraged by policymakers, government, and organizations worldwide. We also describe the founding of our multidisciplinary team and outline lessons learned.

	<SUMMARY>"<U>Changing Incentives for Earnings in Public Housing: a Quasi-Experimental Investigation into the Federal Family Self-Sufficiency Program</U>"</SUMMARY>
	<DT> ABSTRACT: This paper investigates earnings incentives in public housing. For most people living in public housing, the cost of rent is tied to one's income, and an increase in income leads to an increase in rent. This creates a disincentive towards earning more. I study a federal program that removes this connection, allowing residents to stay at their baseline level rent even if their income rises. In partnership with the Cambridge Housing Authority, we automatically enroll some residents in public housing into this program and provide them with financial coaching through the Boston-based nonprofit Compass Working Capital. Using administrative data from all CHA residents, I use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate that enrollment into the program led to an increase of approximately $1,500 to $2,500 in annual income. In addition, I present the descriptive statistics from door-to-door baseline and endline surveys that investigate changes in participants’ psychological and financial wellbeing.

	<SUMMARY>"<U>The "Buy-in Effect": An Experimental Investigation into Encouraging Sustainable Commuting</U>" (with Ashley Whillans and Shibeal O'Flaherty)</SUMMARY>
	<DT> ABSTRACT: Most policy research in behavioral science centers around making engagement with policy programs easier by, for example, removing barriers to entry or setting defaults. We propose that there may be contexts when adding friction may improve welfare: when a program requires effortful follow-through to be successful. In that case, we suggest that creating a more effortful sign-up process may lead individuals to engage more with a program later on. We present results from a large-scale field experiment with the Oregon Department of Transportation that support this hypothesis. Users of a carpool platform were 24% more likely to take any carpool trips when they had an effortful sign-up process than when they had an account made for them. Out of those who took any trips, those that had an effortful sign-up process took on average 8 more trips on the platform. We provide evidence that these estimates are not the result of selection effects.
